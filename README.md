Application stack for launching an eBike hyper local delivery service. This repository hosts the entire
backend logic and the core engine to run an eBike hyper local delivery service. 

## Supporting Repositories
**Rider App** ![RiderApp](https://img.shields.io/badge/React%20Native-yellow) Used by riders with eBikes to view and accept bookings and fulfil an order with pickup and delivery of a small package over a short distance. Generally designed for hyper-local delivery for quick-commerce.

**Admin Portal** ![Admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-orange) Used to administer and monitor all riders and bookings. In case of brick and morter store, used for manual order creation.

**Trip Tracking** ![WebTracking](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-green) A web based interface, that generates a unique tracking link for each trip. The link can be shared with the end customer
to track the process of the trip via a web page.

*Note* Usage of this platform requires either an API based integration with an existing eCommerce storefront, or manual
order creation via the admin portal in case of a brick-and-mortar store.
